### Project Outline
In Escape Dungeon a user attempts to navigate a maze, collect tokens, avoid the ghosts, and make their way to the key. 
This maze has one roving ghost that must be avoided, three tokens that can be collected, and a key that needs to be 
grabbed to escape. Why is the dog locked in a dungeon? We don't actually know, but she needs help bc she is a very 
good girl.

### About Meghan
Meghan is afraid of the dark and also ghosts so this is not an ideal situation for her. She is also afraid of escalators 
but that's irrelevant. She enjoys long walks on the beach and calling her mother. Loves fishing, here for a good time, 
not a long time. Sagittarius. Loyal af... if you can't throw a ball swipe left.

## How To Play
Use your arrow keys to move Meghan the dog through the maze. If Meghan gets eaten by the ghost she dies so, like, try not to. :(
Collecting the tokens gives the user a score, and Meghan needs to make her way to the key to escape. If you collect all 
the tokens, Meghan gets a biscuit.

### Game Object
Get Meghan to the key so she can get out of the dungeon.
If you want to get a higher score, collect the tokens, although it is not necessary for winning the game.

#### Keyboard and Mouse Functionality
* Arrow keys move the dog in any direction.
* 'h' takes the user to the help pages and exits the game
* 'esc' closes the window
